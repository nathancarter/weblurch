# Lean App Tutorial, Part 7

This page assumes you've read Parts [1](tutorial-1.md), [2](tutorial-2.md),
[3](tutorial-3.md), [4](tutorial-4.md), [5](tutorial-5.md), and
[6](tutorial-6.md).

The end of [Part 6](tutorial-6.md) stated that you can use Lean namespaces
just as easily as Lean sections.  This tutorial page covers how to do so.

## Namespaces

Recall the nicely organized theorem from [the previous tutorial
page](tutorial-6.md).

We could do the same thing in a namespace rather than a section, if we
wanted to.  (We might want to in order to avoid filling the global
namespace with too many identifiers, or to organize our code, or to prevent
a clash with an existing theorem name, etc.)

It is a simple matter to change a section into a namespace, or vice versa.

 1. Right-click any text inside the Section bubble (but not inside any inner
    bubble).
 1. From the context menu, choose "Make this a namespace..."
 1. Enter a valid Lean identifier in the box that appears.
 1. Click OK and the section will become a namespace.

To rename the namespace, or convert it back to a section, follow the same
procedure as above, but choosing the appropriate item from the context menu.
They are named in the obvious way.

If the bubble shown above were a namespace, we could then access its
contents outside the namespace using dot notation, as in any Lean code.
See the following example.

## So what?

### Benefits

You can now organize your Lean code into namespaces in this app, just as you
could in Lean.  This is useful for the reasons stated above.

### Missing pieces

The final missing piece is that this app does not seem to use any of the
attractive symbols Lean uses, such as the blackboard bold N for natural
numbers, and so on.

Let's see how to fix that in the final part of the tutorial.
