# User Guide

The webLurch User Guide is for aspiring authors of Lurch documents who want
to learn how to use the software.  It is comprehensive, in the sense that it
begins with the most basics steps, and will eventually include all details
through the most advanced uses of Lurch.

It is a work in progress, documenting features as they are built.  Because
the web version of Lurch is not yet complete, neither is this User Guide.
They will grow together.  *Use the navigation menu at the top for Authors to
access each part of the guide.*

The guide very often includes embedded live examples, which you can edit and
play with (and even save their contents in your browser or in your Dropbox).
They look like this:

<div class='lurch-embed'>
<p>This is an example embedded Lurch document!</p>
</div>

To view an embedded demo using the full app, you have two options.

 * Select all the content, copy it, visit
   [the full app](http://nathancarter.github.io/weblurch/app/app.html),
   and paste.

...or...

 * From the File menu, choose Share document, copy the sharing link,
   paste it into your browser's URL bar, and press Enter.
