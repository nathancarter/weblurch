# Basics: Overview

The "Basics" section of the User Guide shows the reader how to use the Lurch
editor, especially its unique features for extending a human-readable
document with markings that let the computer see the logical reasoning in
that document.

## Who should read this section?

Anyone who plans to use Lurch should read this section.

 * If you're a student who plans to use Lurch in a course, this section is a
   must for you.  (In fact, it may be the only section of the User Guide
   that you need to read.)
 * If you're new to the software, and want a tour of its capabilities, this
   section will provide that as well.
 * If you hope to create new mathematical and/or logical systems within
   Lurch, you should start with this section, but then read on to the other
   sections of the User Guide as well.
