            <h2 align=center>Instructions</h2>
            <p>You are running webLurch in test-recording mode.  This mode
                observes the interactions you make with the app (including
                keystrokes, mouse clicks, and button presses) and records
                them in the form of code that can be replayed as part of the
                app's unit testing suite.  This makes it easy to create new
                unit tests, much like recording a macro in an office
                application.</p>
            <p>This popup window shows a record of your interactions in the
                main application, in the form of code, immediately above
                these instructions.  If you type, click, or push a button in
                the main window, you will see that event appended to the
                code in this window.  To start over, close this window and
                reload the main application.  Do not simply reload this
                popup window.  The language in question is
                <a href='http://www.coffeescript.org/#literate'>literate
                CoffeeScript</a>, the same language used throughout the
                webLurch source repository.</p>
            <p>You will also notice that not all actions in the main
                application are permitted.  Certain keystrokes are not yet
                supported, and drop-down menus have been grayed out, because
                they are also not supported.  This test application is new,
                and still has some imperfections.</p>
            <p>There are six buttons above the code that shows the recorded
                test actions.  They are these:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>T: Set Title - This button will ask you to give your
                    test a title, and will then alter the code to contain
                    the title you've chosen.</li>
                <li>&#x270D;: Add a Comment - This button will prompt you
                    for comment text, then append that comment to the
                    generated code.  You can use this to express intent,
                    uncertainty, suspicion of problems, etc.</li>
                <li>&lt;&gt;: See Editor Contents - This will show you the
                    HTML contents of the current editor, so that you can
                    determine wether they seem correct to you.</li>
                <li>&#x2714;: Mark Editor Contents as Correct - This adds to
                    the generated code an actual test command, one that will
                    (when the test is later run) verify that the editor
                    contents are (at that later time) equal to what they are
                    now (in the testing application) in HTML form.</li>
                <li>&#x2718;: Mark Editor Contents as Incorrect - This adds
                    to the generated code an actual test command, one that
                    will (when the test is later run) FAIL.  It contains the
                    current contents of the editor in HTML form, but marks
                    them as incorrect.  Before inserting this code, the test
                    application will prompt you to explain why the
                    application is in an incorrect state, and will add your
                    explanation to the generated code.  Such generated code
                    will probably need to be edited before it can be used in
                    the real test suite for the application.</li>
                <li>&#x2709;: Email Generated Test to Developers - Launches
                    your email program and composes a message to the main
                    webLurch developer with the current generated test code
                    in the body.  You can then edit the code or add any
                    other explanation you need, and choose whether to send
                    it.  If the test is useful, the development team can
                    then incorporate it into the unit testing suite in the
                    webLurch source repository.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The generated test code is read-only on this page, but you
                can copy it out and paste it elsewhere and edit it if that
                is useful to you, or edit it in your email client before
                submitting it to the developers.  Also, you can feel free to
                incorporate the unit testing code into the source repository
                yourself and submit a pull request on GitHub.  Or just join
                the development team!</p>
