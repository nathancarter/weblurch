# Groups Plugin for [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com)

This plugin adds the notion of "groups" to a TinyMCE editor.  Groups are
contiguous sections of the document, often nested but not otherwise
overlapping, that can be used for a wide variety of purposes.  This plugin
provides the following functionality for working with groups in a document.
 * defines the `Group` and `Groups` classes
 * provides methods for installing UI elements for creating and interacting
   with groups in the document
 * shows groups visually on screen in a variety of ways

It assumes that TinyMCE has been loaded into the global namespace, so that
it can access it.  It also requires [the overlay
plugin](overlayplugin.litcoffee) to be loaded in the same editor.

# `Groups` class

We begin by defining a class that will encapsulate all the functionality
about groups in the editor.  An instance of this class will be stored as a
member in the TinyMCE editor object.

This convention is adopted for all TinyMCE plugins in the Lurch project;
each will come with a class, and an instance of that class will be stored as
a member of the editor object when the plugin is installed in that editor.
The presence of that member indicates that the plugin has been installed,
and provides access to the full range of functionality that the plugin
grants to that editor.

This particular plugin defines two classes, `Group` and `Groups`.  The differences are spelled out here:
 * Only one instance of the `Groups` class exists for any given editor.
   That instance manages global functionality about groups for that editor.
   Some of its methods create instances of the `Group` class.
 * Zero or more instances of the `Group` class exist for any given editor.
   Each instance corresponds to a single group in the document in that
   editor.

If there were only one editor, this could be changing by making all instance
methods of the `Groups` class into class methods of the `Group` class.  But
since there can be more than one editor, we need separate instances of that
"global" context for each, so we use a `Groups` class to do so.

## Constructor

    class Groups

        constructor: ( @editor ) ->

Each editor has a mapping from valid group type names to their attributes.

            @groupTypes = {}

## Registering group types

To register a new type of group, simply provide its name, as a text string,
together with an object of attributes.

The name string should only contain alphabetic characters, a through z, case
sensitive, hyphens, or underscores.  All other characters are removed. Empty
names are not allowed, which includes names that become empty when all
illegal characters have been removed.

Re-registering the same name with a new data object will overwrite the old
data object with the new one.  Data objects may have the following key-value
pairs.
 * key: `open-img`, value: a string pointing to the image file to use when
   the open grouper is visible, defaults to `'images/red-bracket-open.png'`
 * key: `close-img`, complement to the previous, defaults to
   `'images/red-bracket-close.png'`

        addGroupType: ( name, data = {} ) ->
            name = ( n for n in name when /[a-zA-Z_-]/.test n ).join ''
            @groupTypes[name] = data

## Inserting new groups

The following method will wrap the current selection in the current editor
in groupers (i.e., group endpoints) of the given type.  The type must be on
the list of valid types registered with `addGroupType`, above, or this will
do nothing.

        groupCurrentSelection: ( type ) ->

Ignore attempts to insert invalid group types.

            if not @groupTypes.hasOwnProperty type then return

Determine whether existing groupers are hidden or not, so that we insert the
new ones to match.

            groupers = $ @editor.getDoc().getElementsByClassName 'grouper'
            hide = ( $ groupers?[0] ).hasClass 'hide'
            hide = if hide then ' hide' else ''

Create data to be used for open and close groupers, a cursor placeholder,
and the current contents of the cursor selection.

            open = @groupTypes[type]['open-img'] or
                'images/red-bracket-open.png'
            close = @groupTypes[type]['close-img'] or
                'images/red-bracket-close.png'
            open = "<img src='#{open}' class='grouper #{type}#{hide}'>"
            close = "<img src='#{close}' class='grouper #{type}#{hide}'>"
            cursor = '<span id="put_cursor_here">\u200b</span>'
            content = @editor.selection.getContent()

Wrap the current cursor selection in open/close groupers, with the cursor
placeholder after the old selection.

            @editor.insertContent open + content + cursor + close

Replace the placeholder with the actual cursor.  Do so by selecting it and
deleting it.

            cursor = ( $ @editor.getBody() ).find 'put_cursor_here'
            @editor.selection.select cursor.get 0
            cursor.remove()

## Hiding and showing "groupers"

The word "grouper" refers to the objects that form the boundaries of a group, and thus define the group's extent.  Each is an image with specific classes that define its partner, type, visibility, etc.  The following method applies or removes the visibility flag to all groupers at once, thus toggling their visibility in the document.

        hideOrShowGroupers: ->
            groupers = $ @editor.getDoc().getElementsByClassName 'grouper'
            if ( $ groupers?[0] ).hasClass 'hide'
                groupers.removeClass 'hide'
            else
                groupers.addClass 'hide'

<font color=red>This class is not yet complete. See [the project
plan](plan.md) for details of what's to come.</font>

# Installing the plugin

The plugin, when initialized on an editor, places an instance of the
`Groups` class inside the editor, and points the class at that editor.

    tinymce.PluginManager.add 'groups', ( editor, url ) ->
        editor.Groups = new Groups editor
        editor.on 'init', ( event ) -> editor.dom.loadCSS 'groupsplugin.css'



# Load/Save Plugin for [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com)

This plugin will leverage [jsfs](https://github.com/nathancarter/jsfs) to
add load and save functionality to a TinyMCE instance.  It assumes that both
TinyMCE and jsfs have been loaded into the global namespace, so that it can
access both.

# `LoadSave` class

We begin by defining a class that will contain all the information needed
regarding loading and saving a document.  An instance of this class will be
stored as a member in the TinyMCE editor object.

This convention is adopted for all TinyMCE plugins in the Lurch project;
each will come with a class, and an instance of that class will be stored as
a member of the editor object when the plugin is installed in that editor.
The presence of that member indicates that the plugin has been installed,
and provides access to the full range of functionality that the plugin
grants to that editor.

    class LoadSave

## Class variables

As a class variable, we store the name of the app.  We allow changing this
by a global function defined at the end of this file.  Be default, there is
no app name.  If one is provided, it will be used when filling in the title
of the page, upon changes to the filename and/or document dirty state.

        appName: null

It comes with a setter, so that if the app name changes, all instances will
automatically change their app names as well.

        @setAppName: ( newname = null ) ->
            LoadSave::appName = newname
            instance.setAppName newname for instance in LoadSave::instances

We must therefore track all instances in a class variable.

        instances: [ ]

## Constructor

A newly-constructed document defaults to being clean, having no filename,
and using the app name as the filesystem name.  These attributes can be
changed with the setters defined in the following section.

        constructor: ( @editor ) ->
            @setAppName LoadSave::appName
            @setFileSystem @appName
            @setFilepath FileSystem::pathSeparator # root
            setTimeout ( => @clear() ), 0

The following handlers exist for wrapping metadata around a document before
saving, or unwrapping after loading.  They default to null, but can be
overridden by a client by direct assignment of functions to these members.

The `saveMetaData` function should take no inputs, and yield as output a
single object encoding all the metadata as key-value pairs in the object.
It will be saved together with the document content.

The `loadMetaData` function should take as input one argument, an object
that was previously created by the a call to `saveMetaData`, and repopulate
the UI and memory with the relevant portions of that document metadata.  It
is called immediately after a document is loaded.

            @saveMetaData = @loadMetaData = null

Whenever the contents of the document changes, we mark the document dirty in
this object, which therefore adds the \* marker to the page title.

            @editor.on 'change', ( event ) => @setDocumentDirty yes

Now install into the editor controls that run methods in this object.  The
`control` method does something seemingly inefficient to duplicate the input
data object to pass to `addButton`, but this turns out to be necessary, or
the menu items look like buttons.  (I believe TinyMCE manipulates the object
upon receipt.)

            control = ( name, data ) =>
                buttonData =
                    icon : data.icon
                    shortcut : data.shortcut
                    onclick : data.onclick
                key = if data.icon then 'icon' else 'text'
                buttonData[key] = data[key]
                @editor.addButton name, buttonData
                @editor.addMenuItem name, data
            control 'newfile',
                text : 'New'
                icon : 'newdocument'
                context : 'file'
                shortcut : 'ctrl+N'
                onclick : => @tryToClear()
            control 'savefile',
                text : 'Save'
                icon : 'save'
                context : 'file'
                shortcut : 'ctrl+S'
                onclick : => @tryToSave()
            @editor.addMenuItem 'saveas',
                text : 'Save as...'
                context : 'file'
                shortcut : 'ctrl+shift+S'
                onclick : => @tryToSave null, ''
            control 'openfile',
                text : 'Open...'
                icon : 'browse'
                context : 'file'
                shortcut : 'ctrl+O'
                onclick : => @handleOpen()
            @editor.addMenuItem 'managefiles',
                text : 'Manage files...'
                context : 'file'
                onclick : => @manageFiles()

Lastly, keep track of this instance in the class member for that purpose.

            LoadSave::instances.push this

## Setters

We then provide setters for the `@documentDirty`, `@filename`, and
`@appName` members, because changes to those members trigger the
recomputation of the page title.  The page title will be of the form "app
name: document title \*", where the \* is only present if the document is
dirty, and the app name (with colon) are omitted if none has been specified
in code.

        recomputePageTitle: ->
            document.title = "#{if @appName then @appName+': ' else ''}
                              #{@filename or '(untitled)'}
                              #{if @documentDirty then '*' else ''}"
        setDocumentDirty: ( setting = yes ) ->
            @documentDirty = setting
            @recomputePageTitle()
        setFilename: ( newname = null ) ->
            @filename = newname
            @recomputePageTitle()
        setFilepath: ( newpath = null ) -> @filepath = newpath
        setAppName: ( newname = null ) ->
            mustAlsoUpdateFileSystem = @appName is @fileSystem
            @appName = newname
            if mustAlsoUpdateFileSystem then @fileSystem = @appName
            @recomputePageTitle()
        setFileSystem: ( newname = @appName ) -> @fileSystem = newname

## New documents

To clear the contents of the document, use this method in its `LoadSave`
member.  It handles notifying this instance that the document is then clean.
It does *not* check to see if the document needs to be saved first; it just
outright clears the editor.  It also clears the filename, so that if you
create a new document and then save, it does not save over your last
document.

        clear: ->
            @editor.setContent ''
            @setDocumentDirty no
            @setFilename null

Unlike the previous, this function *does* first check to see if the contents
of the editor need to be saved.  If they do, and they aren't saved (or if
the user cancels), then the clear is aborted.  Otherwise, clear is run.

        tryToClear: ->
            if not @documentDirty
                @clear()
                @editor.focus()
                return
            @editor.windowManager.open {
                title : 'Save first?'
                buttons : [
                    text : 'Save'
                    onclick : =>
                        @tryToSave ( success ) => if success then @clear()
                        @editor.windowManager.close()
                ,
                    text : 'Discard'
                    onclick : =>
                        @clear()
                        @editor.windowManager.close()
                ,
                    text : 'Cancel'
                    onclick : => @editor.windowManager.close()
                ]
            }

## Saving documents

To save the current document under the filename in the `@filename` member,
call the following function.  It returns a boolean indicating success or
failure.  If there is no filename in the `@filename` member, failure is
returned and no action taken.  If the save succeeds, mark the document
clean.

        save: ->
            if @filename is null then return
            tmp = new FileSystem @fileSystem
            tmp.cd @filepath
            objectToSave = [ @editor.getContent(), @saveMetaData?() ]
            if tmp.write @filename, objectToSave, yes # use compression
                @setDocumentDirty no

This function tries to save the current document.  When the save has been
completed or canceled, the callback will be called, with one of the
following parameters:  `false` means the save was canceled, `true` means it
succeeded, and any string means there was an error.  If the save succeeded,
the internal `@filename` field of this object may have been updated.

To force a save into a file other than the current `@filename`, pass the
other filename as the optional second parameter.  To force "save as"
behavior when there is a current `@filename`, pass null as the optional
second parameter.

        tryToSave: ( callback, filename = @filename ) ->

If there is a filename for the current document already in this object's
`@filename` member, then a save is done directly to that filename.  If there
is no filename, then a save dialog is shown.

            if filename
                @setFilename filename
                result = @save() # save happens even if no callback
                return callback? result

There is not a readily available filename, so we must pop up a "Save as"
dialog.  First we create a routine for updating the dialog we're about to
show with an enabled/disabled Save button, based on whether there is a file
selected.

            refreshDialog = ->
                dialog = document.getElementsByClassName( 'mce-window' )[0]
                if not dialog then return
                for button in dialog.getElementsByTagName 'button'
                    if button.textContent is 'Save'
                        if filename
                            button.removeAttribute 'disabled'
                            button.parentNode.style.backgroundImage = null
                            button.parentNode.style.backgroundColor = null
                        else
                            button.setAttribute 'disabled', yes
                            button.parentNode.style.backgroundImage = 'none'
                            button.parentNode.style.backgroundColor = '#ccc'
                        break

Now we install a handler for when a file is selected, save that filename for
possible later use, and refresh the dialog.

            filename = null
            @saveFileNameChangedHandler = ( newname ) ->
                filename = newname
                refreshDialog()

Do the same thing for when the folder changes, but there's no need to
refresh the dialog in this case.

            filepath = null
            @changedFolderHandler = ( newfolder ) -> filepath = newfolder

We will also need to know whether the `save` function will overwrite an
existing file, so that we can verify that the user actually wants to do so
before we save.  The following function performs that check.

            saveWouldOverwrite = ( filepath, filename ) =>
                tmp = new FileSystem @fileSystem
                tmp.cd filepath
                null isnt tmp.type filename

Create a handler to receive the button clicks.  We do this here so that if
the dialog clicks a button programmatically, which then passes to us a
message that the button was clicked, we will still hear it through this
handler, because the `window.onmessage` handler installed at the end of this
file will call this function.

            @buttonClickedHandler = ( name, args... ) =>
                if name is 'Save'

If the file chosen already exists, ask the user if they're sure they want to
overwrite it.  If they say no, then we go back to the save dialog.  However,
the dialog, by default, resets itself to "manage files" mode whenever a
button is clicked.  So we put it back in "save file" mode before exiting.

                    if saveWouldOverwrite filepath, filename
                        if not confirm "Are you sure you want to overwrite
                          the file #{filename}?"
                            @tellDialog 'setFileBrowserMode', 'save file'
                            return

Now that we're sure the user wants to save, we store the path and filename
for use in later saves, and perform the save, closing the dialog.

                    @setFilepath filepath
                    @setFilename filename
                    @editor.windowManager.close()
                    result = @save() # save happens even if no callback
                    callback? result
                else if name is 'Cancel'
                    @editor.windowManager.close()
                    callback? no

Now we are sufficiently ready to pop up the dialog.  We use one made from
[filedialog/filedialog.html](filedialog.html), which was copied from [the
jsfs submodule](../jsfs/demo) and modified to suit the needs of this
application.

            @editor.windowManager.open {
                title : 'Save file...'
                url : 'filedialog/filedialog.html'
                width : 600
                height : 400
                buttons : [
                    text : 'Save'
                    subtype : 'primary'
                    onclick : => @buttonClickedHandler 'Save'
                ,
                    text : 'Cancel'
                    onclick : => @buttonClickedHandler 'Cancel'
                ]
            }, {
                fsName : @fileSystem
                mode : 'save file'
            }

## Loading documents

The following function loads into the editor the contents of the file.  It
must be a file containing a string of HTML, because that content will be
directly used as the content of the editor.  The current path and filename
of this plugin are set to be the parameters passed here.

        load: ( filepath, filename ) ->
            if filename is null then return
            if filepath is null then filepath = '.'
            tmp = new FileSystem @fileSystem
            tmp.cd filepath
            [ content, metadata ] = tmp.read filename
            @editor.setContent content
            @setFilepath filepath
            @setFilename filename
            @setDocumentDirty no
            if metadata then @loadMetaData? metadata

The following function pops up a dialog to the user, allowing them to choose
a filename to open.  If they choose a file, it (with the current directory)
is passed to the given callback function.  If they do not choose a file, but
cancel the dialog instead, then null is passed to that callback to indicate
the cancellation. It makes the most sense to leave the callback function the
default, `@load`.

        tryToOpen: ( callback = ( p, f ) => @load p, f ) ->

First we create a routine for updating the dialog we're about to show with
an enabled/disabled Save button, based on whether there is a file selected.

            refreshDialog = ->
                dialog = document.getElementsByClassName( 'mce-window' )[0]
                if not dialog then return
                for button in dialog.getElementsByTagName 'button'
                    if button.textContent is 'Open'
                        if filename
                            button.removeAttribute 'disabled'
                            button.parentNode.style.backgroundImage = null
                            button.parentNode.style.backgroundColor = null
                        else
                            button.setAttribute 'disabled', yes
                            button.parentNode.style.backgroundImage = 'none'
                            button.parentNode.style.backgroundColor = '#ccc'
                        break

Now we install a handler for when a file is selected, save that filename for
possible later use, and refresh the dialog.

            filename = null
            @selectedFileHandler = ( newname ) ->
                filename = newname
                refreshDialog()

Do the same thing for when the folder changes, but there's no need to
refresh the dialog in this case.

            filepath = null
            @changedFolderHandler = ( newfolder ) -> filepath = newfolder

Create a handler to receive the button clicks.  We do this here so that if
the dialog clicks a button programmatically, which then passes to us a
message that the button was clicked, we will still hear it through this
handler, because the `window.onmessage` handler installed at the end of this
file will call this function.

            @buttonClickedHandler = ( name, args... ) =>
                if name is 'Open'
                    @editor.windowManager.close()
                    callback? filepath, filename
                else if name is 'Cancel'
                    @editor.windowManager.close()
                    callback? null, null

Now we are sufficiently ready to pop up the dialog.  We use one made from
[filedialog/filedialog.html](filedialog.html), which was copied from [the
jsfs submodule](../jsfs/demo) and modified to suit the needs of this
application.

            @editor.windowManager.open {
                title : 'Open file...'
                url : 'filedialog/filedialog.html'
                width : 600
                height : 400
                buttons : [
                    text : 'Open'
                    subtype : 'primary'
                    onclick : => @buttonClickedHandler 'Open'
                ,
                    text : 'Cancel'
                    onclick : => @buttonClickedHandler 'Cancel'
                ]
            }, {
                fsName : @fileSystem
                mode : 'open file'
            }
            refreshDialog()

The following handler for the "open" controls checks with the user to see if
they wish to save their current document first, if and only if that document
is dirty.  The user may save, or cancel, or discard the document.

        handleOpen: ->

First, if the document does not need to be saved, just do a regular "open."

            if not @documentDirty then return @tryToOpen()

Now, we know that the document needs to be saved.  So prompt the user with a
dialog box asking what they wish to do.

            @editor.windowManager.open {
                title : 'Save first?'
                buttons : [
                    text : 'Save'
                    onclick : =>
                        @editor.windowManager.close()
                        @tryToSave ( success ) =>
                            if success then @tryToOpen()
                ,
                    text : 'Discard'
                    onclick : =>
                        @editor.windowManager.close()
                        @tryToOpen()
                ,
                    text : 'Cancel'
                    onclick : => @editor.windowManager.close()
                ]
            }

## Communcating with dialogs

When a dialog is open, it is in an `<iframe>` within the main page, which
means that it can only communicate with the script environment of the main
page through message-passing.  This function finds the `<iframe>` containing
the file dialog and (if there was one) sends it the message given as the
argument list.

        tellDialog: ( args... ) ->
            frames = document.getElementsByTagName 'iframe'
            for frame in frames
                if 'filedialog/filedialog.html' is frame.getAttribute 'src'
                    return frame.contentWindow.postMessage args, '*'

## Managing files

The final menu item is one that shows a dialog for managing files in the
filesystem.  On desktop apps, no such feature is necessary, because every
operating system comes with a file manager of its own.  In this web app,
where we have a virtual filesystem, we must provide a file manager to access
it and move, rename, and delete files, create folders, etc.

        manageFiles: ->
            @editor.windowManager.open {
                title : 'Manage files'
                url : 'filedialog/filedialog.html'
                width : 700
                height : 500
                buttons : [
                    text : 'New folder'
                    onclick : => @tellDialog 'buttonClicked', 'New folder'
                ,
                    text : 'Done'
                    onclick : => @editor.windowManager.close()
                ]
            }, {
                fsName : @fileSystem
                mode : 'manage files'
            }

# Global stuff

## Installing the plugin

The plugin, when initialized on an editor, places an instance of the
`LoadSave` class inside the editor, and points the class at that editor.

    tinymce.PluginManager.add 'loadsave', ( editor, url ) ->
        editor.LoadSave = new LoadSave editor

## Event handler

When a file dialog sends a message to the page, we look through the existing
instances of the `LoadSave` class for whichever one wants to handle that
message.  Whichever one has a handler ready, we call that handler.

    window.onmessage = ( event ) ->
        handlerName = "#{event.data[0]}Handler"
        for instance in LoadSave::instances
            if instance.hasOwnProperty handlerName
                return instance[handlerName].apply null, event.data[1..]

## Global functions

Finally, the global function that changes the app name.

    window.setAppName = ( newname = null ) -> LoadSave::appName = newname



# Overlay Plugin for [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com)

This plugin creates a canvas element that sits directly on top of the
editor.  It is transparent, and thus invisible, unless items are drawn on
it; hence it functions as an overlay.  It also passes all mouse and keyboard
events through to the elements beneath it, so it does not interefere with
the functionality of the rest of the page in that respect.

# `Overlay` class

We begin by defining a class that will contain all the information needed
about the overlay element and how to use it.  An instance of this class will
be stored as a member in the TinyMCE editor object.

This convention is adopted for all TinyMCE plugins in the Lurch project;
each will come with a class, and an instance of that class will be stored as
a member of the editor object when the plugin is installed in that editor.
The presence of that member indicates that the plugin has been installed,
and provides access to the full range of functionality that the plugin
grants to that editor.

    class Overlay

We construct new instances of the Overlay class as follows, and these are
inserted as members of the corresponding editor by means of the code [below,
under "Installing the Plugin."](#installing-the-plugin)

        constructor: ( @editor ) ->

The first task of the constructor is to create and style the canvas element,
inserting it at the appropriate place in the DOM.  The following code does
so.  Note the use of `rgba(0,0,0,0)` for transparency, the `pointer-events`
attribute for ignoring mouse clicks, and the fact that the canvas is a child
of the same container as the editor itself.

            @editor.on 'init', =>
                @canvas = document.createElement 'canvas'
                @editor.getContentAreaContainer().appendChild @canvas
                @canvas.style.position = 'absolute'
                @canvas.style.top = @canvas.style.left = '0px'
                @canvas.style['background-color'] = 'rgba(0,0,0,0)'
                @canvas.style['pointer-events'] = 'none'
                @canvas.style['z-index'] = '10'

We then allow any client to register a drawing routine with this plugin, and
all registered routines will be called (in the order in which they were
registered) every time the canvas needs to be redrawn.  Thus the following
line initializes the list of drawing handlers to empty, and the subsequent
function installs an event handler that, each time something in the document
changes, repositions the canvas, clears it, and runs all drawing handlers.

            @drawHandlers = []
            @editor.on 'NodeChange', ( event ) =>
                @positionCanvas()
                context = @canvas.getContext '2d'
                @clearCanvas context
                for doDrawing in @drawHandlers
                    try
                        doDrawing @canvas, context
                    catch e
                        console.log "Error in overlay draw function: #{e}"

The following function permits the installation of new drawing handlers.
Each will receive two parameters (as shown in the code immediately above),
the first being the canvas on which to draw, and the second being the
drawing context.

        addDrawHandler: ( drawFunction ) -> @drawHandlers.push drawFunction

This function is part of the private API, and is used only by
`positionCanvas`, below.  It fetches the `<iframe>` used by the editor in
which this plugin was installed.

        getEditorFrame: ->
            for frame in window.frames
                if frame.document is @editor.getDoc()
                    return frame
            null

This function repositions the canvas, so that if the window is moved or
resized, then before redrawing takes place, the canvas reacts accordingly.
This is called only by the handler installed in the constructor, above.

        positionCanvas: ->
            @canvas.width = @canvas.parentNode.offsetWidth
            @canvas.height = @canvas.parentNode.offsetHeight
            orig = walk = @getEditorFrame()
            isBody = ( e ) -> tinymce.DOM.hasClass e, 'mce-container-body'
            walk = walk.parentNode while walk and not isBody walk
            if walk
                @canvas.style.top = walk.clientHeight - orig.clientHeight

This function clears the canvas before drawing.  It is called only by the
handler installed in the constructor, above.

        clearCanvas: ( context ) ->
            context.clearRect 0, 0, @canvas.width, @canvas.height

# Installing the plugin

The plugin, when initialized on an editor, places an instance of the
`Overlay` class inside the editor, and points the class at that editor.

    tinymce.PluginManager.add 'overlay', ( editor, url ) ->
        editor.Overlay = new Overlay editor



# Add an editor to the app

First, specify that the app's name is "Lurch," so that will be used when
creating the title for this page (e.g., to show up in the tab in Chrome).

    setAppName 'Lurch'

This file initializes a [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com/) editor inside the
[main app page](index.html).  It is designed to be used inside that page,
where [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) has already been loaded, thus defining
the `$` symbol used below.  It use in this context causes the function to be
run only after the DOM has been fully loaded.

    $ ->

Create a `<textarea>` to be used as the editor.

        editor = document.createElement 'textarea'
        editor.setAttribute 'id', 'editor'
        document.body.appendChild editor

Install a TinyMCE instance in that text area, with specific plugins, toolbar
buttons, and context menu items as given below.

        tinymce.init
            selector : '#editor'
            auto_focus : 'editor'

These enable the use of the browser's built-in spell-checking facilities, so
that no server-side callback needs to be done for spellchecking.

            browser_spellcheck : yes
            gecko_spellcheck : yes
            statusbar : no

Not all of the following plugins are working yet, but most are.  A plugin
that begins with a hyphen is a local plugin written as part of this project.

            plugins : 'advlist table charmap colorpicker contextmenu image
                link importcss paste print save searchreplace textcolor
                fullscreen -loadsave -overlay -groups'

We then install two toolbars, with separators indicated by pipes (`|`).

            toolbar : [
                'newfile openfile savefile managefiles | print
                    | undo redo | cut copy paste
                    | alignleft aligncenter alignright alignjustify
                    | bullist numlist outdent indent blockquote | table'
                'fontselect styleselect | bold italic underline
                    textcolor subscript superscript removeformat
                    | link unlink | charmap image
                    | spellchecker searchreplace'
            ]

We then customize the menus' contents as follows.

            menu :
                file :
                    title : 'File'
                    items : 'newfile openfile | savefile saveas
                           | managefiles | print'
                edit :
                    title : 'Edit'
                    items : 'undo redo
                           | cut copy paste pastetext
                           | selectall'
                insert :
                    title : 'Insert'
                    items : 'link media
                           | template hr'
                view :
                    title : 'View'
                    items : 'visualaid'
                format :
                    title : 'Format'
                    items : 'bold italic underline
                             strikethrough superscript subscript
                           | formats | removeformat'
                table :
                    title : 'Table'
                    items : 'inserttable tableprops deletetable
                           | cell row column'
                help :
                    title : 'Help'
                    items : 'about website'

And, finally, we customize the context menu.

            contextmenu : 'link image inserttable
                | cell row column deletetable'

Each editor created will have the following `setup` function called on it.
In our case, there will be only one, but this is how TinyMCE installs setup
functions, regardless.

            setup : ( editor ) ->

Add a Help menu.

                editor.addMenuItem 'about',
                    text : 'About...'
                    context : 'help'
                    onclick : -> alert 'webLurch\n\npre-alpha,
                        not intended for general consumption!'
                editor.addMenuItem 'website',
                    text : 'Lurch website'
                    context : 'help'
                    onclick : -> window.open 'http://www.lurchmath.org',
                        '_blank'

Increase the default font size and maximize the editor to fill the page.

                editor.on 'init', ->
                    editor.getBody().style.fontSize = '16px'
                    setTimeout ( -> editor.execCommand 'mceFullScreen' ), 0

Add Lurch icon to the left of the File menu.

                    filemenu = ( editor.getContainer()
                        .getElementsByClassName 'mce-menubtn' )[0]
                    icon = document.createElement 'img'
                    icon.setAttribute 'src',
                        'icons/apple-touch-icon-76x76.png'
                    icon.style.width = icon.style.height = '26px'
                    icon.style.padding = '2px'
                    filemenu.insertBefore icon, filemenu.childNodes[0]

Workaround for [this bug](http://www.tinymce.com/develop/bugtracker_view.php?id=3162):

                    editor.getBody().addEventListener 'focus', ->
                        if editor.windowManager.getWindows().length isnt 0
                            editor.windowManager.close()
